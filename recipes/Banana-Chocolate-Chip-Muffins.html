        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The right muffin can save your day. It can pull you out of a hungry slump or provide a good jolt of sugar and nutrients
        in the morning.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking for something that twists a classic, this recipe for banana chocolate chip muffins does just that. The
        recipe includes plain yogurt and bananas, so the result will be a soft muffin with great moisture. Banana muffins taste
        similar to banana bread—and very ripe bananas, like banana bread, will work best for this recipe.</p>
        <p>Not to fear though, this recipe is very easy to make: Just combine your dry ingredients and your wet ingredients
        separately, then stir together until combined. Then, you’ll fold in the bananas and chocolate chips, portion into muffin
        tins, and let your oven do the rest of the work.</p>
        <p>Banana Chocolate chip muffins are a nice, warm treat almost anytime. If you like to change up your morning meal now and
        then or take a snack with you for the day, this is a great way to do that. Store these muffins in an airtight container
        at room temperature for up to five days or in the freezer for up to three months. To avoid freezer burn, wrap each
        muffin in plastic wrap and store in a freezer bag or container. Reheat in the microwave or thaw on the counter at room
        temperature when you want one.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 large bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/3 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat muffin pans with non-stick spray, or use paper liners. Sift
            together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside.</li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <li>Combine bananas, sugar, egg, and melted butter in a large bowl. Fold in flour mixture, and mix until smooth. Fold in
            chocolate chips. Scoop into muffin pans.</li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven. Bake mini muffins for 10 to 15 minutes, and large muffins for 25 to 30 minutes. Muffins will
            spring back when lightly tapped.</li>
        </ul>
