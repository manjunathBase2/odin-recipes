    <h2 class="header">Description</h2>
    <p>This easy, stripped-down version of eggs benedict involves no poaching, or hollandaise sauce making, which are the top
    two reasons people don’t make eggs benedict. Even if you master both those elements, and if you’ve seen our videos on
    them there’s a good chance you have, classic eggs benedict is still not something you make for one, which is why this
    method is such an exciting breakthrough. Thanks to some baked-in-a-ham-cup eggs, and a simple-to-make lemon butter
    sauce, the taste is virtually identical to classic eggs Benedict.</p>
    <p>One could argue baked eggs can’t compare to perfectly poached ones, so if you want to poach instead, feel free, but the
    lemon butter sauce here is no compromise. All we’ve done is remove the yolk from a hollandaise, and since we’re serving
    this over eggs, I don’t think it’s going to be missed. In fact, I believe some, if not most, will find this version
    preferable, which is why I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
